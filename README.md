# Mobile Game
 This project goal was to create a fun, simple Android mobile game, in Java, that saved high scores on to a Google Firebase Database in a similar vain to arcade score boards. The game used phoneâ€™s accelerometers and magnet field sensors to control the characters, saved personal high scores on to the phone, and notified the user to come back if they had not played in a few days.

Program may crash due to the removal of some firebase information.
